## Description

You are given three integers l, r, and k.

Consider all possible integers consisting of exactly k digits, where each digit is chosen independently from the integer range [l, r] (inclusive). If 0 is included in the range, leading zeros are allowed.

Return an integer representing the sum of all such numbers.​​​​​​​ Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: l = 1, r = 2, k = 2

Output: 66

Explanation:

	
• All numbers formed using k = 2 digits in the range [1, 2] are 11, 12, 21, 22.
	
• The total sum is 11 + 12 + 21 + 22 = 66.

Example 2:

Input: l = 0, r = 1, k = 3

Output: 444

Explanation:

	
• All numbers formed using k = 3 digits in the range [0, 1] are 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111​​​​​​​.
	
• These numbers without leading zeros are 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111.
	
• The total sum is 444.

Example 3:

Input: l = 5, r = 5, k = 10

Output: 555555520

Explanation:​​​​​​​

	
• 5555555555 is the only valid number consisting of k = 10 digits in the range [5, 5].
	
• The total sum is 5555555555 % (10^9 + 7) = 555555520.

 

Constraints:

	
• 0 <= l <= r <= 9
	
• 1 <= k <= 10^9

## Hints

- Hint 1: Use combinatorics.
- Hint 2: For some position p among the k digits, the sum is 10^p * (l + (l+1) + ... + r) * (r - l + 1)^(k-1).
- Hint 3: Summing p over [0, k-1] gives (l + (l+1) + ... + r) * (r - l + 1)^(k-1) * (10^k - 1) / 9.
