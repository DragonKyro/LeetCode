## Description

Given a 2D grid of 0s and 1s, return the number of elements in the largest square subgrid that has all 1s on its border, or 0 if such a subgrid doesn't exist in the grid.


 

Example 1:



Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 9




Example 2:



Input: grid = [[1,1,0,0]]
Output: 1




 

Constraints:



	
• 1 <= grid.length <= 100
	
• 1 <= grid[0].length <= 100

## Hints

- Hint 1: For each square, know how many ones are up, left, down, and right of this square. You can find it in O(N^2) using dynamic programming.
- Hint 2: Now for each square ( O(N^3) ), we can evaluate whether that square is 1-bordered in O(1).
