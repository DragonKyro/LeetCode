## Description

You are given two integer arrays prices and strategy, where:

	
• prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the i^th day.
	
• strategy[i] represents a trading action on the i^th day, where:
	

		
• -1 indicates buying one unit of the stock.
		
• 0 indicates holding the stock.
		
• 1 indicates selling one unit of the stock.
	

	

You are also given an even integer k, and may perform at most one modification to strategy. A modification consists of:

	
• Selecting exactly k consecutive elements in strategy.
	
• Set the first k / 2 elements to 0 (hold).
	
• Set the last k / 2 elements to 1 (sell).

The profit is defined as the sum of strategy[i] * prices[i] across all days.

Return the maximum possible profit you can achieve.

Note: There are no constraints on budget or stock ownership, so all buy and sell operations are feasible regardless of past actions.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [4,2,8], strategy = [-1,0,1], k = 2

Output: 10

Explanation:

	
		
			Modification
			Strategy
			Profit Calculation
			Profit
		
	
	
		
			Original
			[-1, 0, 1]
			(-1 × 4) + (0 × 2) + (1 × 8) = -4 + 0 + 8
			4
		
		
			Modify [0, 1]
			[0, 1, 1]
			(0 × 4) + (1 × 2) + (1 × 8) = 0 + 2 + 8
			10
		
		
			Modify [1, 2]
			[-1, 0, 1]
			(-1 × 4) + (0 × 2) + (1 × 8) = -4 + 0 + 8
			4
		
	

Thus, the maximum possible profit is 10, which is achieved by modifying the subarray [0, 1]​​​​​​​.

Example 2:

Input: prices = [5,4,3], strategy = [1,1,0], k = 2

Output: 9

Explanation:

	
		
			Modification
			Strategy
			Profit Calculation
			Profit
		
	
	
		
			Original
			[1, 1, 0]
			(1 × 5) + (1 × 4) + (0 × 3) = 5 + 4 + 0
			9
		
		
			Modify [0, 1]
			[0, 1, 0]
			(0 × 5) + (1 × 4) + (0 × 3) = 0 + 4 + 0
			4
		
		
			Modify [1, 2]
			[1, 0, 1]
			(1 × 5) + (0 × 4) + (1 × 3) = 5 + 0 + 3
			8
		
	

Thus, the maximum possible profit is 9, which is achieved without any modification.

 

Constraints:

	
• 2 <= prices.length == strategy.length <= 10^5
	
• 1 <= prices[i] <= 10^5
	
• -1 <= strategy[i] <= 1
	
• 2 <= k <= prices.length
	
• k is even

## Hints

- Hint 1: Use prefix sums to precompute the base profit and to get fast range queries (sums of prices and counts of each strategy value over any interval).
- Hint 2: Try every segment of length k: compute the profit delta caused by replacing that segment (using the prefix queries) and take the maximum of base + delta.
