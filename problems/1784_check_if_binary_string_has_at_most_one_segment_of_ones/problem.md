## Description

Given a binary string s ​​​​​without leading zeros, return true​​​ if s contains at most one contiguous segment of ones. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "1001"
Output: false
Explanation: The string has two segments of size 1.

Example 2:

Input: s = "110"
Output: true

 

Constraints:

	
• 1 <= s.length <= 100
	
• s[i]​​​​ is either '0' or '1'.
	
• s[0] is '1'.

## Hints

- Hint 1: It's guaranteed to have at least one segment
- Hint 2: The string size is small so you can count all segments of ones with no that have no adjacent ones.
