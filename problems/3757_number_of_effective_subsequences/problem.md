## Description

You are given an integer array nums.

The strength of the array is defined as the bitwise OR of all its elements.

A subsequence is considered effective if removing that subsequence strictly decreases the strength of the remaining elements.

Return the number of effective subsequences in nums. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

The bitwise OR of an empty array is 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]

Output: 3

Explanation:

	
• The Bitwise OR of the array is 1 OR 2 OR 3 = 3.
	
• Subsequences that are effective are:
	

		
• [1, 3]: The remaining element [2] has a Bitwise OR of 2.
		
• [2, 3]: The remaining element [1] has a Bitwise OR of 1.
		
• [1, 2, 3]: The remaining elements [] have a Bitwise OR of 0.
	

	
	
• Thus, the total number of effective subsequences is 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [7,4,6]

Output: 4

Explanation:​​​​​​​

	
• The Bitwise OR of the array is 7 OR 4 OR 6 = 7.
	
• Subsequences that are effective are:
	

		
• [7]: The remaining elements [4, 6] have a Bitwise OR of 6.
		
• [7, 4]: The remaining element [6] has a Bitwise OR of 6.
		
• [7, 6]: The remaining element [4] has a Bitwise OR of 4.
		
• [7, 4, 6]: The remaining elements [] have a Bitwise OR of 0.
	

	
	
• Thus, the total number of effective subsequences is 4.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [8,8]

Output: 1

Explanation:

	
• The Bitwise OR of the array is 8 OR 8 = 8.
	
• Only the subsequence [8, 8] is effective since removing it leaves [] which has a Bitwise OR of 0.
	
• Thus, the total number of effective subsequences is 1.

Example 4:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]

Output: 5

Explanation:

	
• The Bitwise OR of the array is 2 OR 2 OR 1 = 3.
	
• Subsequences that are effective are:
	

		
• [1]: The remaining elements [2, 2] have a Bitwise OR of 2.
		
• [2, 1] (using nums[0], nums[2]): The remaining element [2] has a Bitwise OR of 2.
		
• [2, 1] (using nums[1], nums[2]): The remaining element [2] has a Bitwise OR of 2.
		
• [2, 2]: The remaining element [1] has a Bitwise OR of 1.
		
• [2, 2, 1]: The remaining elements [] have a Bitwise OR of 0.
	

	
	
• Thus, the total number of effective subsequences is 5.

 

Constraints:

	
• 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
	
• 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6

## Hints

- Hint 1: The bitwise OR is reduced if a bit is completely removed from the array OR.
- Hint 2: To completely remove a bit, all of its occurrences must be removed from the array.
- Hint 3: Count such subsets and apply inclusion-exclusion on the bits.
